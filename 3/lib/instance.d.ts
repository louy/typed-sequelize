 * This class represents an single instance, a database row. You might see it referred to as both Instance and

 * represented by the instance. By default, the values from dataValues can also be accessed directly from the
 * Instance, that is:
 * ```js
 * instance.field
 * // is the same as
 * instance.get('field')
 * // is the same as
 * instance.getDataValue('field')
 * ```
 * However, if getters and/or setters are defined for `field` they will be invoked, instead of returning the
 * value from `dataValues`. Accessing properties directly or using `get` is preferred for regular use,
 * `getDataValue` should only be used for custom getters.
